<h3>Edit 04-17-2016: Download and Delete</h3>
<p>If you are unhappy with the way the text loaded into Pattern Partner, you can download the pattern as a
plain text file to be edited in your favorite text editor. Then delete the pattern from your library and upload
the edited text file for a perfect formatting. Download and Delete buttons can be found under the title on the
"View Pattern" page.</p>
<br />

<h3>Edit 04-23-2016: Repeat Buttons</h3>
<p>If your pattern has a "repeat" in it (ie. repeat row 13 seven times), you now can keep track of what repeat
you are on right on the pattern page! Just press the plus button to add a row, minus to remove, and clear to set
the repeat to 0. Your repeat value will be saved along with the current row and will load up next time you open the pattern.</p>
