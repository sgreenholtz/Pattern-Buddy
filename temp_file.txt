There was a time when I would have laughed at someone who tried to 
describe to me the "luxury" of crocheted dishcloths. That was before I tried 
them myself! Now I understand what I was missing: the perfect combination 
of textured scrubbie-ness and cotton softness.  
 
This is my go-to pattern for basic dishcloths.  The smaller ones are perfect 
for dishes and the bigger ones for wiping counters and keeping stray messes 
in check.  And they look lovely, too. 
 
Enjoy! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Materials:  Approximately 1.5 ounces of worsted weight cotton for the JustRight and 
2 ounces of worsted weight cotton for the BigTime version.  Size I (5.50 mm) 
crochet hook.  Tapestry needle for weaving ends. 
 
Abbreviations (U.S. notation): 
 
ch...chain stitch 
hdc...half double crochet 
sc...single crochet 
st…stitch 
 
Notes: 
 
Gauge is not terribly important here, and with dishcloths I generally find it easier to 
work a few rows, check to make sure I’m not wildly off of the expected (or desired) 
finished size, and rip if I need to.  That said, I get roughly 3.5 stitches and 4 rows to 
the inch in the pattern stitch. 
 
This pattern stitch works with any odd number of starting chains. The key is that in 
the setup row and each subsequent row you’re working an even number, so that 
your sc is worked in the previous row’s hdc and vice versa. 
 
Finished size: Approximately 8.5 inches (21.6 cm) square for the JustRight version 
and 10 inches (25.4 cm) square for the BigTime version. 
 
Where the instructions have different counts or measurements for the two versions, 
they’re presented as JustRight (BigTime). 
 
The Pattern: 
 
Chain 29 (35). 
 
Row 1: Sc in 2nd ch from the hook and each st across: 28 
(34) sc. Ch 1, turn. 
 
Row 2: [Sc in next sc, hdc in next sc] across. Ch 1, turn. 
 
Row 3: [Sc in next hdc, hdc in next sc] across. Ch 1, turn. 
 
Repeat Row 3 until piece measures 8.25 inches (9.75 
inches) [21 cm (24.75 cm)], or .25 inch [.65 cm] shorter 
than the piece is wide.  
 
Finishing Row: Sc across: 28 (34) sc.   
 
Fasten off. 
 
Weave in ends and you’re done!  Enjoy your dishcloth!
