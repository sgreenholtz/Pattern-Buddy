# Pattern Partner
Source code  and documentation for knit and crochet pattern application, called Pattern Partner

### Problem: 
Knit and crochet patterns are created by professional pattern writers and hobbyists in various different arrangements and layouts. While there are standard symbols to describe the pattern, they are rarely laid out in a standard way. Furthermore, they are often printed in PDF files or on web pages that render poorly on mobile devices and don't support helpful tools like highlighting what row you are on.

### Solution: 
A mobile-friendly application that takes patterns in a variety of file types (PDF and text) and formats the text in a standard, easy to read way, while preserving any charts and images. The files are saved into a library for users to use and reuse. The application supports row highlighting and has a row counter to keep track of repeats.

### What will I learn: 
Creating an application that reads from and writes to files, using library files, application deployment, web server hosting, basic AJAX

### Future Developments:
- Processing of HTML files/website-hosted patterns
- Processing of Word files
- Android application version
