Grandmother's Favorite Dishcloth

The cloth in this photo was stitched by Joyce Skeens. Thanks to Knitting Exchange for letting me post it on this site.
Rating: Easy
Contributor's Note: My grandmother found out that I had learned to knit. She called me up to ask me if I would knit her some dishcloths. I told her I would, but I had never made any (so I needed a pattern). She explained that her older sister, Thelma (who is 99 this year), had always made these for the family and sent me a box with the pattern and a whole bunch of the "Sugar and Cream " yarn. The pattern goes so quick, that I have made some for, well, everyone in the family.
Wendy's Warning: None of my friends had ever used one of these cloths before, and once you give one away and they find out that you can Scrub Glass with one, you will be knitting these things for the rest of your life. Just ask Great Aunt Thelma!
