Basic Pattern for Children's Mittens

Avid community knitter Elizabeth Durand generously offers the free use of her simple 4-needle mitten pattern for charitable purposes.

Elizabeth also shares her on-line tutorial to help you knit wonderful, warm mittens.

Sizes:

Small size fits children 4-6 years old. 
Medium size fits children 8-10 years old.
Large size fits children 12-14 years old (or small woman).

Materials:

2-3-4 oz. sport-weight yarn (to be used doubled) or worsted-weight yarn.
1 set of double-pointed needles, size 6 or 7 (or size to get gauge).

Gauge: 5 sts/inch

Cast on 28 (32) (36) sts.
Divide sts among the needles. Join in round, taking care not to twist.
Rib for 2 (3) (3.5) inches (either K1P1 or K2P2, as you wish).
Next row: K around, increasing 2 (4) (4) sts evenly spaced for a total of 30 (36) (40) sts.
K 3 (4) (4) rounds.

(Note: "m1" means make 1 -- cast on a new stitch by whatever means you prefer, either casting on with the backward loop or picking up the thread between two existing stitches and knitting into that.)

Make thumb gusset:
␞Round 1: K3, place marker, m1, K2, m1, place marker, knit around (4 sts between markers).
␞Round 2: K around.
Repeat rounds 1 and 2, increasing one stitch after the first stitch marker and one stitch before the second stitch marker on every odd-numbered row until you have 10 (12) (14) sts between markers.
Knit one round after last increases.
Remove thumb stitches as follows: K3, place 10 (12) (14) sts between markers on a holder or a strand of yarn, cast on 2, continue around.
You now have 30 (36) (40) sts on your needles.
K 16 (19) (20) rounds.
